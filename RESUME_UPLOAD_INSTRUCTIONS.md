- Make sure your resume is in PDF format
- Name it exactly: `Hana_Berhe_Girmay_Resume.pdf`

## Step 2: Upload to the project
1. In your project files, navigate to the `public/resume/` folder
2. Delete the empty placeholder file if it exists
3. Upload your actual resume PDF file
4. Make sure it's named exactly: `Hana_Berhe_Girmay_Resume.pdf`

## Step 3: Test the download
- Go to your portfolio website
- Click the "Download Resume" button
- Your actual resume should download

The download functionality is already working - it just needs your real resume file in the correct location.
